# Simple Records

I was looking for an already established contact-sharing system (not a CRM) wherea group of people could have granular access to contact individuals in the EU.

The GDPR requires Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to be hidden from those who do not need access to it. This makes it difficult for churches to communicate to their members. A ChurchCMS handles this situation quite regularly, but most of the ChurchCMS creators are based in the US. The GDPR requires data to be located in the EU. I have looked at open source ChurchCMS, but many do not have granular access on PII. I have looked at closed-source ChurchCMS and they require the churches to store data in the US and sign a document. While some EU citizens will not mind this circumstance, it will not be adequate for data-conscious Finnish people.

This project is for personal reasons and is not intended to replace a larger project such as BreezeChCMS or Planning Center.
